# BattleshipAI

Battleship AI is a board game transformed into an artificial intelligence game where AIs compete against each other many times (usually a competition is 1 million games).  The object of the game is to find and sink all of your opponents ships before they do the same to you.

I worked on Sobek and then Anubis.  These AIs work by cycling through different attack and placement methods and try to find the best one for the current opponent.
